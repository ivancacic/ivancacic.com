My name is Ivan Cacic, I work as a solution architect for a systems integrator in Melbourne, Australia. My day to day role is helping customers in their collaboration journey, in the past I worked heavily on the Citrix stack with particular focus on the NetScaler product. I currently deal with a wide range of IT systems (and problems), my expertise is in NetScaler, Office 365 and Azure AD.

The goal of this website is to hopefully offer others some guidance which has helped me along the way, as well as serve as a reference point of my own for common issues I see.

If you would like to get in touch, feel free to contact me at [me@ivancacic.com](mailto:me@ivancacic.com) or via any of the mediums below.
